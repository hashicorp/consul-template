This project provides a convenient way to populate values from [Consul][consul]
into the file system using the `consul-template` daemon.

The daemon `consul-template` queries a [Consul][consul], [Vault][vault], or [Nomad][nomad]
cluster and updates any number of specified templates on the file system. As an
added bonus, it can optionally run arbitrary commands when the update process
completes. Please see the [examples folder][examples] for some scenarios where
this functionality might prove useful.

1. Move the binary into `$PATH`.

To compile from source, please see the instructions in the
[contributing section](#contributing).

## Quick Example

This short example assumes Consul is installed locally.

1. Start a Consul cluster in dev mode:

  ```shell
  $ consul agent -dev
  ```

1. Author a template `in.tpl` to query the kv store:

  ```liquid
  {{ key "foo" }}
  ```

1. Start Consul Template:

  ```shell
  $ consul-template -template "in.tpl:out.txt" -once
  ```

1. Write data to the key in Consul:

  ```shell
  $ consul kv put foo bar
  ```

1. Observe Consul Template has written the file `out.txt`:

  ```shell
  $ cat out.txt
  bar
  ```

## Configuration

Configuration documentation has been moved to [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Reload Configuration and Templates

While there are multiple ways to run Consul Template, the most common pattern is
to run Consul Template as a system service. When Consul Template first starts,
it reads any configuration files and templates from disk and loads them into
memory. From that point forward, changes to the files on disk do not propagate
to running process without a reload.

The reason for this behavior is simple and aligns with other tools like haproxy.
A user may want to perform pre-flight validation checks on the configuration or
templates before loading them into the process. Additionally, a user may want to
update configuration and templates simultaneously. Having Consul Template
automatically watch and reload those files on changes is both operationally
dangerous and against some of the paradigms of modern infrastructure. Instead,
Consul Template listens for the `SIGHUP` syscall to trigger a configuration
reload. If you update configuration or templates, simply send `HUP` to the
running Consul Template process and Consul Template will reload all the
configurations and templates from disk.

## Templating Language

Templating Language documentation has been moved to
[docs/templating-language.md](docs/templating-language.md).

## Caveats

### Docker Image Use

The Alpine Docker image is configured to support an external volume to render
shared templates to. If mounted you will need to make sure that the
consul-template user in the docker image has write permissions to the
directory. Also if you build your own image using these you need to be sure you
have the permissions correct.

**The consul-template user in docker has a UID of 100 and a GID of 1000.**

This effects the in image directories /consul-template/config, used to add
configuration when using this as a parent image, and /consul-template/data,
exported as a VOLUME as a location to render shared results.

Previously the image initially ran as root in order to ensure the permissions
allowed it. But this ran against docker best practices and security policies.

If you build your own image based on ours you can override these values with
`--build-arg` parameters.

### Dots in Service Names

Using dots `.` in service names will conflict with the use of dots for [TAG
delineation](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template#service) in the
template. Dots already [interfere with using
DNS](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/services.html#service-and-tag-names-with-dns)
for service names, so we recommend avoiding dots wherever possible.

### Termination on Error

By default Consul Template is highly fault-tolerant. If Consul is unreachable or
a template changes, Consul Template will happily continue running. The only
exception to this rule is if the optional `command` exits non-zero. In this
case, Consul Template will also exit non-zero. The reason for this decision is
so the user can easily configure something like Upstart or God to manage Consul
Template as a service.

If you want Consul Template to continue watching for changes, even if the
optional command argument fails, you can append `|| true` to your command. Note
that `||` is a "shell-ism", not a built-in function. You will also need to run
your command under a shell:

```shell
$ consul-template \
  -template "in.ctmpl:out.file:/bin/bash -c 'service nginx restart || true'"
```

In this example, even if the Nginx restart command returns non-zero, the overall
function will still return an OK exit code; Consul Template will continue to run
as a service. Additionally, if you have complex logic for restarting your
service, you can intelligently choose when you want Consul Template to exit and
when you want it to continue to watch for changes. For these types of complex
scripts, we recommend using a custom sh or bash script instead of putting the
logic directly in the `consul-template` command or configuration file.

### Commands

#### Environment

The current processes environment is used when executing commands with the following additional environment variables:

- `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR`
- `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN`
- `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE`
- `CONSUL_HTTP_AUTH`
- `CONSUL_HTTP_SSL`
- `CONSUL_HTTP_SSL_VERIFY`
- `NOMAD_ADDR`
- `NOMAD_NAMESPACE`
- `NOMAD_TOKEN`

These environment variables are exported with their current values when the
command executes. Other Consul tooling reads these environment variables,
providing smooth integration with other Consul tools (like `consul maint` or
`consul lock`). Additionally, exposing these environment variables gives power
users the ability to further customize their command script.

#### Multiple Commands

The command configured for running on template rendering must take one of two
forms.

The first is as a list of the command and arguments split at spaces. The
command can use an absolute path or be found on the execution environment's
PATH and must be the first item in the list. This form allows for single or
multi-word commands that can be executed directly with a system call. For
example...

`command = ["echo", "hello"]`
`command = ["/opt/foo-package/bin/run-foo"]`
`command = ["foo"]`

Note that if you give a single command without the list denoting square
brackets (`[]`) it is converted into a list with a single argument.

This:
`command = "foo"`
is equivalent to:
`command = ["foo"]`

The second form is as a single quoted command using system shell features. This
form **requires** a shell named `sh` be on the executable search path (eg. PATH
on \*nix). This is the standard on all \*nix systems and should work out of the
box on those systems. This won't work on, for example, Docker images with only
the executable and without a minimal system like Alpine. Using this form you
can join multiple commands with logical operators, `&&` and `||`, use pipelines
with `|`, conditionals, etc. Note that the shell `sh` is normally `/bin/sh` on
\*nix systems and is either a POSIX shell or a shell run in POSIX compatible
mode, so it is best to stick to POSIX shell syntax in this command. For
example..

`command = "/opt/foo && /opt/bar"`

`command = "if /opt/foo ; then /opt/bar ; fi"`

Using this method you can run as many shell commands as you need with whatever
logic you need. Though it is suggested that if it gets too long you might want
to wrap it in a shell script, deploy and run that.

#### Shell Commands and Exec Mode

Using the system shell based command has one additional caveat when used for
the Exec mode process (the managed, executed process to which it will propagate
signals). That is to get signals to work correctly means not only does anything
the shell runs need to handle signals, but the shell itself needs to handle
them. This needs to be managed by you as shells will exit upon receiving most
signals.

A common example of this would be wanting the SIGHUP signal to trigger a reload
of the underlying process and to be ignored by the shell process. To get this
you have 2 options, you can use `trap` to ignore the signal or you can use
`exec` to replace the shell with another process.

To use `trap` to ignore the signal, you call `trap` to catch the signal in the
shell with no action. For example if you had an underlying nginx process you
wanted to run with a shell command and have the shell ignore it you'd do..

`command = "trap '' HUP; /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf"`

The `trap '' HUP;` bit is enough to get the shell to ignore the HUP signal. If
you left off the `trap` command nginx would reload but the shell command would
exit but leave the nginx still running, not unmanaged.

Alternatively using `exec` will replace the shell's process with a sub-process,
keeping the same PID and process grouping (allowing the sub-process to be
managed). This is simpler, but a bit less flexible than `trap`, and looks
like..

`command = "exec /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf"`

Where the nginx process would replace the enclosing shell process to be managed
by consul-template, receiving the Signals directly. Basically `exec` eliminates
the shell from the equation.

See your shell's documentation on `trap` and/or `exec` for more details on this.

### Multi-phase Execution

Consul Template does an n-pass evaluation of templates, accumulating
dependencies on each pass. This is required due to nested dependencies, such as:

```liquid
{{ range services }}
{{ range service .Name }}
  {{ .Address }}
{{ end }}{{ end }}
```

During the first pass, Consul Template does not know any of the services in
Consul, so it has to perform a query. When those results are returned, the
inner-loop is then evaluated with that result, potentially creating more queries
and watches.

Because of this implementation, template functions need a default value that is
an acceptable parameter to a `range` function (or similar), but does not
actually execute the inner loop (which would cause a panic). This is important
to mention because complex templates **must** account for the "empty" case. For
example, the following **will not work**:

```liquid
{{ with index (service "foo") 0 }}
# ...
{{ end }}
```

This will raise an error like:

```text
<index $services 0>: error calling index: index out of range: 0
```

That is because, during the _first_ evaluation of the template, the `service`
key is returning an empty slice. You can account for this in your template like
so:

```liquid
{{ with service "foo" }}
{{ with index . 0 }}
{{ .Node }}{{ end }}{{ end }}
```

This will still add the dependency to the list of watches, but will not
evaluate the inner-if, avoiding the out-of-index error.

## Debugging

Consul Template can print verbose debugging output. To set the log level for
Consul Template, use the `-log-level` flag:

```shell
$ consul-template -log-level info ...
```

```text
<timestamp> [INFO] (cli) received redis from Watcher
<timestamp> [INFO] (cli) invoking Runner
# ...
```

You can also specify the level as debug:

```shell
$ consul-template -log-level debug ...
```

```text
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (cli) creating Runner
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (cli) creating Consul API client
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (cli) creating Watcher
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (cli) looping for data
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (watcher) starting watch
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (watcher) all pollers have started, waiting for finish
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (redis) starting poll
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (service redis) querying Consul with &{...}
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (service redis) Consul returned 2 services
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (redis) writing data to channel
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (redis) starting poll
<timestamp> [INFO] (cli) received redis from Watcher
<timestamp> [INFO] (cli) invoking Runner
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (service redis) querying Consul with &{...}
# ...
```

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different than confd?**<br>
A: The answer is simple: Service Discovery as a first class citizen. You are also encouraged to read [this Pull Request](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/pull/102) on the project for more background information. We think confd is a great project, but Consul Template fills a missing gap. Additionally, Consul Template has first class integration with [Vault][vault], making it easy to incorporate secret material like database credentials or API tokens into configuration files.

**Q: How is this different than Puppet/Chef/Ansible/Salt?**<br>
A: Configuration management tools are designed to be used in unison with Consul Template. Instead of rendering a stale configuration file, use your configuration management software to render a dynamic template that will be populated by [Consul][consul].
