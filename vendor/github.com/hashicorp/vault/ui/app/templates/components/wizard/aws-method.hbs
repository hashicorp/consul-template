  <p>
    The AWS auth method provides an automated mechanism to retrieve a Vault token for AWS EC2 instances and IAM principals. Unlike most Vault auth methods, this method does not require manual first-deploying, or provisioning security-sensitive credentials (tokens, username/password, client certificates, etc), by operators under many circumstances.
