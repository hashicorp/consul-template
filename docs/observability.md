## Logging

Consul Template can print verbose debugging output. To set the log level for
Consul Template, use the `-log-level` flag:

```shell
$ consul-template -log-level info ...
```

Or set it via the `CONSUL_TEMPLATE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

```text
<timestamp> [INFO] (cli) received redis from Watcher
<timestamp> [INFO] (cli) invoking Runner
# ...
```

You can also specify the level as debug:

```shell
$ consul-template -log-level debug ...
```

```text
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (cli) creating Runner
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (cli) creating Consul API client
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (cli) creating Watcher
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (cli) looping for data
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (watcher) starting watch
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (watcher) all pollers have started, waiting for finish
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (redis) starting poll
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (service redis) querying Consul with &{...}
<timestamp> [DEBUG] (service redis) Consul returned 2 services
