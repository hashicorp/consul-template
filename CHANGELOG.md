## v0.7.0 (February 19, 2015)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * Remove `ssl` configuration option from templates - use an `ssl`
    configuration block with `enabled = true` instead
  * Remove `ssl_no_verify` configuration option from templates - use an `ssl`
    configuration block with `verify = false` instead
  * Restructure CLI `-ssl-no-verify` to `-ssl-verify` - to disable SSL
    certification validation on the command line, use `-ssl-verify=false`
  * Remove `auth` configuration option from templates - use an `auth`
    configuration block with `enabled = true` combined with `username = ...` and
    `password = ...` inside the block instead

FEATURES:

  * Add support for logging to syslog (GH-163)
  * Add `log_level` as a configuration file option
  * Add `-log-level` as a CLI option

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Use a default retry interval of 5s (GH-190) - this value has been (and will
    remain) configurable since v0.5.0, but the default value has changed from 0
    to 5s
  * Use a service's reported address if given (GH-185, GH-186)
  * Add new `NodeAddress` field to health services to always include the node's
    address

    determine what to do with the error instead of swallowing it (GH-196)
  * Move SSL and authentication options into their own configuration blocks in
    the HCL
  * Add new `watch.WaitVar` for parsing Wait structs via Go's flag parsing
    library.
  * Extract logging components into their own library for sharing (GH-199)

BUG FIXES:

  * Return errors instead of nil in catalog nodes and key prefix dependencies
    (GH-192)
  * Allow Consul Template to exit when running in `once` mode and templates have
    not changed (GH-188)
  * Raise an error when specifying a non-existent option in the configuration
    file (GH-197)

  * Improve debugging output and consistency
  * Remove unused Brain functions
  * Remove unused documentation items
  * Use the correct default values for `-ssl` and `-retry` on the CLI

## v0.6.5 (February 5, 2015)

FEATURES:

  * Add `-max-stale` to specify Consul Template may talk to non-leader Consul
    nodes if they are less than the maximum stale value (GH-183)

BUG FIXES:

  * Fix a concurrency bug in the Brain (GH-180)

    of dependencies (GH-184)

## v0.6.1 (February 2, 2015)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Allow watcher to use buffered channels so we do not block when multiple
    dependencies return data (GH-176)

    and GH-178)

  * Handle the case where reloading via SIGHUP would cause an error (GH-175 and
    GH-177)
  * Return errors to the template when parsing a key fails (GH-170)
  * Expand the list of possible values for keys to non-ASCII fields (the `@` is
    still a restricted character because it denotes the datacenter) (GH-170)
  * Diff missing dependencies during the template render to avoid creating
    extra watchers (GH-169)
  * Improve debugging output (GH-169)

## v0.6.0 (January 20, 2015)

FEATURES:

  * Implement n-pass evaluation (GH-64) - templates are now evaluated N+1 times
    to properly accumulate dependencies and build the graph properly

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Switch to using `hashicorp/consul/api` instead of `armon/consul-api`
  * Add support for communicating with Consul via HTTPS/SSL (GH-143)
  * Add support for communicating with Consul via BasicAuth (GH-147)
  * Quiesce on a per-template basis

  * Update README documentation

## v0.5.1 (December 25, 2014)

BUG FIXES:

FEATURES:

  * Reload configuration on `SIGHUP`

  * Accept Windows drive letters in template paths (GH-78)
  * Deep copy and sort data returned from Consul API (specifically tags)
  * Run commands even if not all templates have received data (GH-119)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add support for more complex service health filtering (GH-116)
  * Add support for specifying a `-retry` interval for Consul timeouts and

  * Allow colons in key prefixes (`ls` and `tree` receive this by proxy)
  * Allow `parseJSON` to handle top-level JSON objects
  * Filter empty keys in `tree` and `ls` (folder nodes)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Merge multiple configuration template definitions when a configuration
    directory is specified

## v0.3.1 (November 24, 2014)

BUG FIXES:

  * Allow colons in key names (GH-67)
  * Fix a documentation bug in the README in the Varnish example (GH-82)
  * Attempt to render templates before starting the watcher - this fixes an
    issue where a template that declared no Consul dependencies would never be
    rendered (GH-85)
  * Update inline Go documentation for better clarity

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Fix all issues raised by `go vet`
  * Update packaging script to fix ZSHisms and use awk for clarity

## v0.3.0 (November 13, 2014)

FEATURES:

  * Added a `Contains` method to `Service.Tags`

    addition to a file
  * Added support for querying all nodes in Consul's catalog with the `nodes`
    template function

BUG FIXES:

  * Update README documentation to clarify that `service` dependencies default
    to the current datacenter if one is not explicitly given
  * Ignore empty keys that are returned from an `ls` call (GH-54)
  * When writing a file atomicly, ensure the drive is the same (GH-58)
  * Run all commands before exiting - previously if a single command failed in
    a multi-template environment, the other commands would not execute, but
    Consul Template would return

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Added support for querying all `service` nodes by passing an additional
    parameter to `service`

## v0.2.0 (November 4, 2014)

FEATURES:

  * Added helper for decoding a result as JSON using the `parseJSON` pipe
    function

    substring with a new string
  * Added `tree` function for returning all key prefixes recursively
  * Added `ls` function for returning all keys in the top-level prefix (but not
    deeply nested ones)

BUG FIXES:

  * Remove prefixes from paths when querying a key prefix

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Moved shareable functions into a util module so other libraries can benefit
  * Make Path a public field on Template
  * Added more examples and documentation to the README
